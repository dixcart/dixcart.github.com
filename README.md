# My github page

## What's all this then?

I've been looking at other people's github pages and thought "Hey these are pretty cool".
I also thought that I should get round to making one myself but found that I'm pretty bad
in the content department. Therefore I've decided to use JAVASCRIPT to create the content
for me!

## So what pages do you get?

So far this gives a project page (showing your original projects and your forks), a people
page (showing people you follow) and an about page (which gives a short summary of who you
are and even puts down your bio if you've filled it out). This should be more than enough
info for anyone who cares.

## What does this use?

At this time:

* [bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap)
* [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
* [ICanHaz.js](https://github.com/andyet/ICanHaz.js)

## Can I use this?

Sure! Why else would I bother making some JavaScript to generate the page?

## Who made this again? I forget
